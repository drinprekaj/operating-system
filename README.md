# Building an OS

## Introduction

Welcome to my Operating System (OS) project! This repository contains the code and resources for developing a fully-fledged operating system, including the kernel, bootloader, and various other components. This project is based on numerous resources such as the OSDev wiki, various books, tutorials, and other open-source projects.

## Project Overview

Creating an operating system is a complex and rewarding challenge that involves a deep understanding of computer architecture, low-level programming, and various development tools. This project aims to build an operating system from scratch, including:

- **Kernel**: Manages hardware resources, schedules processes, handles memory management, and provides a file system.
- **Bootloader**: Initializes the hardware and loads the kernel.
- **Other Components**: Includes drivers, system libraries, and user space programs.

Obviously, a project of this magnitude will take a long time (even if it's rudimentary in the end) and these are just the beginning stages of this project. It's particularly difficult because you have to establish all the low-level and funamental pieces of software that get the machine running. You have to worry about things like memory allocation and management, and the most basic forms of communication between the hardware, since without an OS, there's no piece of software to execute commands and follow instructions. That has to be created from scratch.

## Skills and Knowledge Required

Developing an operating system requires a diverse set of skills and knowledge, including but not limited to:

- **Low-Level Programming**: Proficiency in languages like C and Assembly.
- **Computer Architecture**: Understanding of CPU architecture, memory management, and hardware interfaces.
- **Operating System Concepts**: Knowledge of process scheduling, interrupt handling, file systems, and system calls.
- **Development Tools**: Familiarity with tools like GNU Binutils, GCC, QEMU, and Make.
- **Debugging**: Ability to use debugging tools like GDB for low-level code.

## Languages Used

- **C**: For most of the kernel and system libraries.
- **Assembly**: For the bootloader and low-level hardware interaction.
- **Other Languages**: Depending on specific needs, such as shell scripting for build automation.

## Tools and Resources

Building an operating system requires a variety of tools and resources, including:

- **GNU Binutils**: A collection of binary tools like `as` (assembler) and `ld` (linker).
- **GCC**: The GNU Compiler Collection, used for compiling C and Assembly code.
- **QEMU**: An open-source machine emulator and virtualizer, used for testing the OS.
- **Make**: A build automation tool used to manage compilation.
