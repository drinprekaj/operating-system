# My Operating System Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Operating System (OS) project! This repository contains the code and resources for developing a fully-fledged operating system, including the kernel, bootloader, and various other components. This project is based on numerous resources such as the OSDev wiki, various books, tutorials, and other open-source projects.

## Project Overview

Creating an operating system is a complex and rewarding challenge that involves a deep understanding of computer architecture, low-level programming, and various development tools. This project aims to build an operating system from scratch, including:

- **Kernel**: Manages hardware resources, schedules processes, handles memory management, and provides a file system.
- **Bootloader**: Initializes the hardware and loads the kernel.
- **Other Components**: Includes drivers, system libraries, and user space programs.

## Skills and Knowledge Required

Developing an operating system requires a diverse set of skills and knowledge, including but not limited to:

- **Low-Level Programming**: Proficiency in languages like C and Assembly.
- **Computer Architecture**: Understanding of CPU architecture, memory management, and hardware interfaces.
- **Operating System Concepts**: Knowledge of process scheduling, interrupt handling, file systems, and system calls.
- **Development Tools**: Familiarity with tools like GNU Binutils, GCC, QEMU, and Make.
- **Debugging**: Ability to use debugging tools like GDB for low-level code.

## Languages Used

- **C**: For most of the kernel and system libraries.
- **Assembly**: For the bootloader and low-level hardware interaction.
- **Other Languages**: Depending on specific needs, such as shell scripting for build automation.

## Tools and Resources

Building an operating system requires a variety of tools and resources, including:

- **GNU Binutils**: A collection of binary tools like `as` (assembler) and `ld` (linker).
- **GCC**: The GNU Compiler Collection, used for compiling C and Assembly code.
- **QEMU**: An open-source machine emulator and virtualizer, used for testing the OS.
- **Make**: A build automation tool used to manage compilation.

## Getting Started

To get started with building and testing the operating system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourosproject.git
    cd yourosproject
    ```

2. **Set Up the Development Environment**:
    Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:
    - `GNU Binutils`
    - `GCC`
    - `QEMU`
    - `Make`

3. **Build the Project**:
    ```sh
    make all
    ```

4. **Run the OS in QEMU**:
    ```sh
    make run
    ```

## Resources and References

This project is based on a wide range of resources and references, including:

- [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org): Comprehensive resource for OS development.
- Various books on operating system design and implementation.
- Online tutorials and open-source OS projects.
